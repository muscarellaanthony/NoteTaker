# Note Taker

## Description
My first deep dive into express.js. I made this application to test my abilities with GET, POST, and DELETE functions in my first back end server. This app allows you to write down notes and save them for later. At anytime, you can add a new note or delete an old one. 

## Installation
Visit [Note Taker](https://notetaker-ugd1.onrender.com/)

## Usage 
To use this app, press the get started button located on the home page, that will navigate you to the notes page. From there, enter a title and body for your note in the provided field. Click save note in the top right hand corner to finish your entry and save your note. You can click on saved notes at anytime to view their content, or hit the red trash can next to them to delete them.
